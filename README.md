## Modelling of the Airport and Understanding the Impact of Infrastructure Improvements

The project focuses on modeling airport terminal operations and analyzing the impact of infrastructure improvements and terminal closure using discrete-event simulation techniques.

Passenger flow at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), Delhi is modeled to analyze:

- Normal terminal operations (T1, T2, T3)
- The closure of Terminal 2 (T2) and redistribution of passengers
- The effect of infrastructure enhancements (additional counters, security lanes)
- Optimal passenger redistribution strategies to minimize congestion
